Birth of MCP(2023-2024)
    1) Anthropic introduced Model context protocol(MCP).
        -> Structured communication between LLMs and external tools/data
    2) Early needs:
        -> Build MCP servers(tools/resources/prompts)
        -> Build MCP clients(apps consuming those servers)
    3) Official Python SDK(mcp) released:
        -> mcp.server -> build servers
        -> mcp.client -> build clients
        -> mcp.cli -> CLI for debugging/testing
    4) This becomes the reference implementation.


Developer Friction and FastMCP 1.x (2024)
    1) Problem:- Raw SDK = verbose and boilerplate heavy.
        -> Manual list_tools, call_tool, list_prompts, etc.
        -> Explicit schema definitions required.
    2) Solution:- FastMCP helper inside SDK (mcp.server.fastmcp)
    3) Decorator-driven, type-hint aware:
        from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
        mcp = FastMCP("Demo")

        @mcp.tool()
        def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
            return a + b
    4) Popular for teaching and Prototyping


FastMCP Breaks Out of MCP and becomes a seperate entity(2025)
    1) FastMCP adoption grows rapidly.
    2) SDK maintainers goal:
        -> Keep SDK minimal & Spec-focused
        -> Let FastMCP evolve faster(Qol APIs, transports, integrations).
    3) FastMCP 2.x released as standalone package:
        pip install fastmcp
        from fastmcp import FastMCP
        fastmcp version
    4) Highly compatible with 1.x, but may diverge over time


Where Things Stand(Late 2025)
    1) MCP SDK(mcp)
        -> Official, spec-compliant, stable
        -> install: pip install mcp[cli]
    2) MCP CLI(mcp ...)
        -> Ships with SDK
        -> Inspect, debug, test servers.
    3) FastMCP 2.x(fastmcp)
        -> Standalone, community-driven, fast-evolving.
        -> Ideal for students, educators, rapid prototypes.
        -> Not official reference, but more ergonomic.
