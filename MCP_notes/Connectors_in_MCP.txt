What are Connectors?
    A Connector is a built-in features that links claude to MCP servers automatically, without the need of manual setup or configuration.

    Most Claude Desktop users are non-technical and end-users who just want claude to "talk" to their apps(Notion, Google Drive, Github, Slack, etc.).

    They don't want to run servers, edit JSON, or worry about transport.

    The Connector system wraps an MCP server behind the scenes and handles authentication via OAuth(sign-in with google, Github, etc.)

    This keeps things easy, safe and consistent.


Why not use Connectors always?
    Connectors are curated and managed
        *) Connectors are officially built, hosted and maintained by anthropic.
        *) They came with OAuth login flows, managed security, rate-limits, and guaranteed stability.
        *) If every MCP server were required to be a Connector, it would mean anthropic has to review, host, and secure every possible server -> which does'nt scale.


    MCP is an Open standard
        *) MCP is designed so anyone can write a server.
        *) Forcing everything through Connectors would close the ecosystem and make you dependant on Anthropic to approve or publish servers.
