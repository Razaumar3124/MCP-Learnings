MCP Primitives:
1) Tools - Actions which AI asks the server to perform.
2) Resources - Structure Data sources that the AI can read.
3) Prompts - Predifined prompt templates or instructions that the server offers to help shape the AI's behaviour.

The Prompts Primitives

Below is the use case of mcp where we have to raise an issue on github using client
and also Below is an example on how we create a prompt on server and when llm uses it it gives us correct output:

{
    "name": "issue_report_prompt",
    "description": "Write clear, detailed GitHub issues",
    "messages": [
        {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "Always include: Title, Steps to Reproduce, Expected, Actual, Environment"
        }
    ]
}

below is the output how it will generate the output in systematic order.

"

---------------------- Primitives - Standard Operations ----------------------------
Tools:
    1) tools/list -> Client asks the server: "What tools do you provide?" -> It will goto the server and fetch all the tools and functionalities in list format.
    for example:
        I have github mcp server and in that server there is function for creating issue, push the code, to commit the code, read the number of repositories.

    2) tools/call -> Client tells the server: "Please run this tool with these arguments." -> here we can the specific functionality which we want to call or invoke using it.
    for example:- 
        If i want to create a new issue on github i will just call create issue function 

Resourses:
    1) resources/list -> Client asks: "What resourses are available?" -> It will tell how many static documents present in the server which we can later fetch.

    2) resources/read -> Client says: "Give me the content of this resources?" -> With the help of this we can read a particular document.

    3) resources/subscribe /unsubscribe -> Client subscribes or unsubscribes from the updates. -> If there are changes in document then server will tell us and on unsubscribe changes will not be shown to user.

Prompts:
    1) prompts/list -> Client asks "What prompt templates do you provide?" -> Its is use is also same it shows list of all functions.

    2) prompts/get -> Client fetches a specific prompt template.
