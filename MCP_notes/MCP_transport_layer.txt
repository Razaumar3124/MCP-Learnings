MCP Transport Layer:
    The Transport Layer is the mechanism that moves JSON-RPC messages between the client and server.
    The choice of tranport depends on the type of server.

    In MCP there are 2 types of servers:
        1) Remote servers :- A remote server is a program running on another computer(somewhere else on the network or internet) that you connect to over a network. remote servers using http + sse combination.
        2) Local servers :- A local server is a program running on your own computer.


    Local Server - STDIO(Standard Input/Output):
        STDIO refers to the built-in streams every program has.
        STDIN (input the program reads)
        STDOUT (output the program writes)

        In MCP, these streams are used as transport layer between the client and server.

        This works in three steps:-
            1) The host launches the server as a subprocess on the same machine. then the parent child connection has been established between host and the server which means host has the control of servers standard input/output.

            2) Using the above point the client(host) writes JSON-RPC messages into the server's STDIN.

            3) The server reads those messages, processes them, and writes back responses to it's STDOUT.

    Benefits of STDIO transport:
        1) Fast - data is passed directly between processes.
        2) secure - no open network port that could be attacked; communication is only local.
        3) simple - every language/runtime supports reading/ writing from STDIN/STDOUT. No extra libraries required.  

    Remote Servers HTTP + SSE:
        1) Using HTTP allows the host to reach servers running anywhere.
        2) Host sends JSON-RPC requests using POST requests with a JSON payload.
        3) The transport supports standard HTTP auth methods (like API keys).

        SSE:
            1) SSE stands for Server Sent Events, and its on extension of http.
            2) Using SSE the server sends multiple messages to client over a single open connection.
            3) Instead of sending one large JSON blob, the server can stream chunks of data as they are ready.
